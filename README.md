# Deconvoluting Low Yield from Weak Potency in Direct-to-Biology Workflows with Machine Learning

This repo contains the data and code needed to reproduce the methodology and results for the paper "Deconvoluting Low Yield from Weak Potency in Direct-to-Biology Workflows with Machine Learning".

The folder `data` contains the raw experimental data from both the initial direct-to-biology screen as well as the subsequent prospective screens.

The folder `notebooks` contains notebooks for generating the figures and calculating the metrics in the paper.

The folder `scripts` contains the python scripts used for training and inferencing the machine learning models used, as well as the cheminformatics scripts used to enumerate building blocks from EnamineREAL.

TO-DO:
- upload data
- add dependencies
- scripts for model training
- notebooks for plotting
- notebooks for metric calculation
